# learnspanish

This website is dedicated to helping with learning how to say numbers in Spanish. This website has been built to teach the numbers to non-Spanish speakers; however, it can be used by Spanish speakers too. The website can be found in this domain, and it is available to everyone: https://learnspanish.gurucan.es/. The web has been up and running since January 2021.
